# This file will point to the hosts that will be configured by the playbook.yml.
#
# When Raspberry Pi is installed with the Raspbian distro, it will automatically
# have the hostname 'raspberrypi' and Avahi will advertise it in your LAN as
# raspberrypi.local so you do not need to find out the IP address.
#
# If you use another Raspberry Pi distro, you should find out the IP address of
# the new device (e.g. with nmap or your router's dhcp listing) and replace the 
# hostname below with the IP address.
